# Performance

## Goal

Measure end-to-end server latency for control-plane commands through the real websocket/API surface, establish reproducible baselines under representative load, and track the effect of each optimization branch with before/after artifacts.

## Hypotheses

- `H1` Control-plane commands are waiting behind provider stream ingestion because `thread.create`, `thread.archive`, and chunk-derived commands all share the same serialized orchestration path.
- `H2` Projection work per streamed chunk is inflating queue occupancy enough to delay unrelated commands.
- `H3` Terminal output and git-heavy repositories add secondary pressure that can compound the control-plane delay seen in the sidebar.

## Workstreams

- `[completed]` Add server-first perf baselines for websocket command latency under stream, terminal, and git load.
- `[completed]` Establish baseline artifacts and summarize p50/p95 timings here.
- `[completed]` Reconcile the baseline with the manual sidebar lag repro before cutting optimization branches.
- `[completed]` Optimization 2: reduce per-event projection overhead.
- `[completed]` Optimization 3: prioritize control-plane dispatch over internal stream traffic.
- `[pending]` Optimization 4: reduce global worker head-of-line blocking in runtime ingestion/reactors.
- `[pending]` Optimization 5: evaluate adapter/service queue hops and any additional bottlenecks found during measurement.

## Notes

- The initial perf suite is characterization-first. It should fail only on obvious hangs/timeouts while we collect stable p50/p95 numbers for this machine and repository.
- Each optimization will land on its own branch and append a new row here with the measured delta and artifact path.
- Current takeaway: the redline server-side repro is real. The biggest measured wins came from shrinking per-chunk projection cost and then prioritizing control-plane commands over internal stream traffic. The remaining work, if we keep pushing, is in worker topology and the provider-side queue hops rather than the websocket boundary itself.
